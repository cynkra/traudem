      Input file blop.tif has projected coordinate system.

      This run may take on the order of  minutes to complete.
      This estimate is very approximate. 
      Run time is highly uncertain as it depends on the complexity of the input data 
      and speed and memory of the computer. This estimate is based on our testing on 
      a dual quad core Dell Xeon E .GHz PC with GB RAM.
