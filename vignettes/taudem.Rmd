## How to install TauDEM

Installing TauDEM actually means installing 3 tools

* GDAL that TauDEM uses under the hood;
* MPI that R will call to launch TauDEM;
* TauDEM itself.

No matter your operating system, take notes of the steps you follow.
This way, if anything goes wrong, you will be able to open an informative bug report and get help more easily.

### Windows

You're in luck! 
The TauDEM Windows installer will install all three tools at once! 
Refer to <https://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/downloads.html>.

```{r, child="_sitrep.Rmd"}

```
